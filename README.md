**S**mart **P**hone running **Li**nux from **C**ommodity **E**lectronics

## Purpose
To develop a smart phone that runs general purpose (i.e. desktop) Linux distributions utilizing commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) electronic components.

## Design Criteria
The device must meet the following criteria for minimum viable product (MVP):
1. Run general purpose Linux operating system 
2. Be hand held and pocketable
3. Be capable of 4G LTE, Bluetooth, and 802.11* (a/b/g/n/ac/ax/...) connectivity
4. Be able to make and accept calls over cellular
5. Be able to create and receive MMS and SMS text messages

### Design Philosophy
While the intent is to develop a device consisting of exclusively COTS components, some compromises may need to be made with regards to integration. For example, removing component casements or splicing and soldering connectors to achieve a smaller overall form factor. It **will** be possible to have a fully functional device without removing extraneous pieces. Further optimization of components and custom integration will be documented in depth to allow users to decide how to proceed on their own, especailly in the event of component mismatch between the bill of materials (BOM) and what a user is able to obtain.
